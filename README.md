If you're starting a new blog, you want to clone-and-go. Just `git clone https://github.com/redwallhp/solar-theme-jekyll.git`, make any changes you want to the template, pages or `_config.yml` and start blogging with Jekyll. Easy.

If you're wanting to replace the theme of an existing Jekyll blog, either option should work. If you want to replace files individually, the files and directories you want to make sure to copy are:

1. `_layouts`
2. `archives`
3. `assets`
4. `feed.xml`
5. `index.xml`

You'll also want to compare Solar's `_config.yml` with your own, making any appropriate changes.
