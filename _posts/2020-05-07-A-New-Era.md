I am very happy with my new [Jeykll blog](https://jekyllrb.com). I'm hosting it on <a href="http://github.io" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. It's easy. I don't need any fancy plugins so I don't need to explore that aspect of Jekyll.

I'm on windows by the way. Which sucks but I need affordable computing that can perform well with Adobe CC.

I never liked any of the dual boot crap or the cigwin. They are annoying and I usually think they are causing more harm to my system than good.

I'd love to be able to _**have the option**_ to install plugins. I know this is entirely up to github - but I'd be willing to pay a small fee to do so.

I'm going to post this to Github pages forum and see what happens.

BTW: I'm a digital designer by trade. I'm dangerous with the command line - as well as other programming languages. lol
