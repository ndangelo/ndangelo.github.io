###Teaching Art &#8211; Composition

####>Finding the visual sweet spots&nbsp;



<div class="madtinker_main"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21132839/ruleofthirds2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-56911" width="389" height="263"/></figure></div>



<p><strong>Version 1. </strong>Middle? No. When designing the composition of a drawing or<br>painting you need to make it interesting to the viewer. Try not the place your focal point dead center. &nbsp;It&#8217;s boring. Artist&#8217;s no.1 no-no rule.</p>

<p><strong>Version 2.</strong> A little better…&nbsp;Here change happens in the composition<br>when the focal point hits a &#8220;sweet spot&#8221; in the composition.<br>But it&#8217;s not quite there &#8211; the horizon line is too close to the center of the paper.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Version 3. </strong>The keeper! This composition offers a pleasing balance<br>while being more dramatic &amp; interesting then version 2. The horizon line 2/3rds high.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a couple things I said as students were drawing:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>DO&nbsp;overlap objects to add depth to your drawing.&nbsp;</li><li>DON&#8217;T place objects that almost touch or are &#8220;tickling&#8221;&nbsp;each others edges.&nbsp;</li><li>DO group objects&nbsp;creatively &#8211; have fun!</li><li>DON&#8217;T&nbsp;balance equally &#8211; this is boring.</li><li>THINK about where your horizon line is &#8211; should it be in the center of your paper?&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p><strong>Types of composition:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Two Ways to Look at Composition: Focus and Effects</strong>.<br>We can use compositions to guide the viewer&#8217;s eye to a point or points we want them to look at. Focus.</p>

<p>Shapes like circles, triangles, L shapes draw the viewers eye, into and around an image.</p>

<p>A composition can also create a feeling, an effect on the viewer.</p>

<p>Diagonals create a feeling of movement and action. Here’s a classic impressionist painting I love. The artist&#8217;s viewpoint on the bridge create’s diagonal lines that draw the viewer into the painting and give a feeling of action.</p>

<p>The street, the sidewalk, the bridge, the buildings in the background. But what’s interesting is how they are in contrast to the people in the frame.</p>

<p>A couple casually walking, a man peering over the bridge with his head resting in his hands, a dog strolling.</p>



<p><strong>Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Balance</strong></p>



<p>Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Balance can create feelings of Unity or contrast</p>
