<p><strong>What is a still life?</strong>&nbsp;Here is a definition provided by&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Still_life" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

---

<blockquote>A work of art depicting mostly inanimate subject matter, typically commonplace objects which may be either natural or man-made</blockquote>

<ul><li>Viewable first-hand</li><li>Visually interesting, with a range of different textures, reflections, surfaces and forms</li><li>Small enough to set up and arrange in the classroom (light, easily moveable)</li><li>Able to arranged in different ways, creating original compositions so that multiple exciting works can be created</li><li>Durable enough to be handled safely by enthusiastic teenagers (without sharp or dangerous parts, for example)</li><li>Able to stored from lesson to lesson without eroding, decaying or breaking (this is not necessary if the still life can be drawn within a single lesson or photographed for completion at a later date)</li><li>Appropriate for younger students to view (i.e. not offensive)</li></ul>

<h3>50+ Still Life Drawing Ideas</h3>

<p><strong>Popcorn</strong>, as in these original still life artworks by Po Yuan (left) and Betty Chen (right), students of &nbsp;<a href="http://www.elizabethjendek-visualarts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elizabeth Jendek</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tcis.ac.th/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thai Chinese International School</a>, Samutprakarn, Thailand:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140239/popcorn-still-life-drawing-1.jpg" alt="popcorn still life drawing" class="wp-image-6789"/><figcaption>Although there is a distinct possibility that a number of still life items might mysteriously ‘disappear’ during the course of this lesson, popcorn provides an excellent opportunity for practising the application of tone. Completed in charcoal, these large works create a kind of semi-abstracted landscapes and require careful attention to light and shadow.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Crumpled paper bags</strong>, such as this work by 18 year old artist&nbsp;<a href="https://instagram.com/p/wMdhilI-jt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raegan Koepsel</a>:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140239/drawing-paper-bags-1.jpg" alt="paper bag drawing" class="wp-image-6790"/><figcaption>Crunched and creased paper bags create dramatic shadows and provide an excellent opportunity to learn about tone. This is a great subject to draw with charcoal&nbsp;on mid-tone grey or brown paper. In this example, the paper bags have been twisted in different ways and carefully contrasted with a background of corrugated cardboard.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Styrofoam cups</strong>, as inspired by this activity by the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eastcityart.com/uncategorized/dc-sketchers-the-perception-of-spaces-relationships-via-styrofoam-cups/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DC Sketchers</a>:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140240/drawing-ellipses-1.jpg" alt="drawing ellipses: Styrofoam cups" /><figcaption>This is an excellent drawing activity to help students understand how to represent ellipses (the oval shape that is visible when a circle is viewed from angle). The hollow truncated cones become surrounded by shadows and beautiful pockets of curving negative space, creating a superb still life drawing lesson.

<p><strong>Machinery and mechanical parts</strong>, such as old sewing machines, disassembled clocks, cogs/wheels and typewriters, inspired by this drawing from Parkway North High School, United States, taught by Art teacher and artist&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pkwy.k12.mo.us/north/teachers/gkniffen/AP%20Studio/APStudio.htm%20gkniffen@pkwy.k12.mo.us%20kniffeng@yahoo.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grant Kniffen</a>:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140241/typewriter-drawing-1.jpg" alt="typewriter drawing - great still life idea" /><figcaption>When the inner workings of mechanical items are exposed, there are often endless opportunities for art-making. In this observational drawing, the complex letter keys, crunched paper and detailed ink ribbon contrast the smooth surfaces of the typewriter and tabletop.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Driftwood, rope and fishing accessories</strong>, as inspired by these Roy Lichtenstein still life compositions (images ©&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Estate of Roy Lichtenstein</a>):</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140242/roy-lichtenstein-still-life-1.jpg" alt="Roy Lichtenstein still life" /><figcaption>Many high school Art projects within New Zealand are based around the beach and coastline. Items such as rope, floats, hooks, anchors, driftwood and fishing nets provide an excellent subject matter for still life works due to the variety of shapes, forms, patterns and surface textures. The items are usually large and substantial enough that a still life arrangement in the centre of the room can be viewed easily by all students. These two works by American Pop artist, Roy Lichtenstein, ‘Cape Cod Still life’ and ‘Cape Cod Still Life (Study)’ show nets and rope entangled around an driftwood and shells. The bottom work is an oil and Magna (a brand of acrylic resin paint) completed in 1972, with a drawn composition study above.</figcaption></figure>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140243/crustaceans-IGCSE-art-1.jpg" alt="drawing of crustaceans - IGCSE Art" class="wp-image-6784"/><figcaption>Still life paintings of fish and other sea creatures can make for an exciting lesson – especially when the real items are slapped onto the centre of tables in the Art room (it may be worth checking out where these can be stored in between class – staff rooms may have space in the freezer)!</figcaption></figure>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140244/microscope-drawing-1.jpg" alt="microscope still life drawing" class="wp-image-6795"/><figcaption>Drawing exercises such as this can be a great way for making connections between other subject areas within the school. In this case, it might be possible to mimic a scientific experiment that students are currently learning about. Note the stunning composition in this work, with the combination of slightly curving textbook images and text providing an appropriate background to the detailed three-dimensional microscope.</figcaption></figure>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140245/line-weight-still-life-1.jpg" alt="line weight still life drawings" class="wp-image-6796"/><figcaption>Wooden mannequins can be great still life additions, posed as if the figure is interacting / responding to its environment. In this still life drawing lesson, varied line weight has been used to create depth and create focal areas within the work.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Armchairs, chairs or stools</strong>, as in this example by&nbsp;<a href="http://dmunozvidal18.blogspot.co.nz/2010/11/chairs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daniel E. Munoz-Vidal</a>:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140246/drawing-of-chairs-1.jpg" alt="drawing of chairs" class="wp-image-6797"/><figcaption>Art classes may only have access to mundane stools. Sometimes, however, an Art teacher will acquire an old chair, sofa or carved wooden chair that can become a permanent addition to still life collection. In this well composed drawing, chairs and tables have been positioned so that their forms intersect and slice up the page.</figcaption></figure>

---

<p><strong>Dolls, train sets and other toys</strong>, such as this observational drawing of a teddy bear completed as part of an AQA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.studentartguide.com/gallery/memories">GCSE Art and Design project</a>&nbsp;student by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/hollyreynoldsart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Holly Reynolds</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;King Edward VI Camp Hill School For Girls:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140247/teddy-bear-drawing-1.jpg" alt="teddy bear drawing" class="wp-image-6798"/><figcaption>Still life paintings of toys are a popular choice amongst middle and high school Art students. Although there can be risks with drawing cartoon-like toys, or those with distorted proportions (it can be difficult for an examiner to tell whether the drawing is badly proportioned rather than the toy itself, for example) items such as old and broken dolls, ancient teddy bears and intricate train sets make excellent still life material. This A3 drawing by Holly was completed from first-hand observation, in response to the topic ‘Memories’, using a range of graphite pencils (5H – 9B) and a putty eraser.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Bottles, vases, jugs and vessels</strong>&nbsp;(this topic was inspired by a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinterest.com/highcrestart/bottles-vases-vessels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highcrest Academy Art Department Pinterest board</a>), such as the famous&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nyartbeat.com/event/2008/E8D6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Giorgio Morandi</a>&nbsp;still life drawings, etchings and paintings:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140247/giorgio-morandi-still-life-drawings-e1439893351440-1.jpg" alt="Giorgio Morandi still life" class="wp-image-6799"/><figcaption>Giorgio Morandi, a famous still life artist who died in 1964, is well known for his deceptively simple still life artworks, which repeat many familiar household items, such as vases, bowls and bottles. Morandi positions these with careful precision, with each object treated as if it were a sculptural entity: a formal exploration of space and form. His paintings in particular have a subtle use of tone. The 1928 etching above, titled “Grande natura morta con la lampada a destra”, may inspire students to produce pen drawings that have a similar cross-hatching aesthetic.</figcaption></figure>

---

<p><strong>Empty boxes</strong>, inspired by a drawing exercise completed by a student of&nbsp;<a href="http://nikimade.com/drawing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicole Havekost</a>:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140248/still-life-empty-boxes-1.jpg" alt="Still life of empty boxes" class="wp-image-6800"/><figcaption>Boxes provide a great contemporary still life objects. At first glance boxes seem simple to draw; they are comprised of primarily straight lines, flat planes, with little detail; however, this task demands a good understanding of perspective and challenges students to really use their eyes to observe the variation in tone. Previously unnoticed details begin to jump into vision: creases, text, peeling edges of cellotape. This activity could be presented as a quick still life gesture drawing or a meticulous, detailed observation of angles, planes, light and form.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Jewellery and treasure boxes</strong>, as in these still life paintings by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.studentartguide.com/featured/a-igcse-art-coursework" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGCSE Art and Design</a>&nbsp;student, Nikau Hindin, ACG Parnell College:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140249/jewellery-still-life-1.jpg" alt="jewellery still life" class="wp-image-6787"/><figcaption>This work was produced within several drawing lessons that asked students to produce still life paintings with dark backgrounds (such as the necklace shown on black acrylic paint) and work over other prepared grounds (for example, the still life on the left is completed using Carandache crayon upon&nbsp;watered down acrylic). The jewellery boxes provide students with the opportunity to represent three-dimensional space, while the jewellery itself adds glistening, detailed focal areas within the work.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Preserved animals and other specimens in jars</strong>, such as these modern still life artworks&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cindywright.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cindy Wright</a>:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140250/cindy-wright-paintings-1.jpg" alt="Cindy Wright still life paintings" class="wp-image-6794"/><figcaption>In addition to insects, Science Departments often have wonderful preserved animal specimens that make for great still life subjects. If these are unavailable, you might wish to create your own dramatic interpretation, based on the still life compositions above by Cindy Wright. These works force us to meet the lifeless gaze of gutted fish coiled within a glass fish bowl.</figcaption></figure>

---

<p><strong>Fruit and vegetables</strong>, inspired by&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Cezanne</a>’s still life with apples:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140251/cezanne-still-life-with-apples-1.jpg" alt="Cezanne still life with apples" class="wp-image-6801"/><figcaption>Fruit and vegetables are inexpensive enough that large quantities can be purchased for classroom use, allowing students to organise the still life arrangements themselves or in small groups. Dedicated students may bring more unusual items from home. Although a still life comprised of fresh food is unlikely to last longer than a week (less within rambunctious classrooms) vegetables such as garlic, potatoes, onions, gourds and pumpkins can be kept for a much longer duration. There is also the opportunity to include wooden tables and other still life items in the background. These famous still life paintings by Paul Cezanne are titled ‘Rideau, Cruchon et Compotier’ (which means Curtain, Jug and Fruit Bowl) and ‘The Basket of Apples’ (the lower artwork). Both still life paintings are completed using oil and canvas in the 1890s and judged by some to be among the best still life paintings ever.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Vintage cameras</strong>, as in these collection of observational drawings by Year 9 student Dougal Burden from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.takapuna.school.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Takapuna Grammar School</a>:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140252/vintage-camera-drawings-1.jpg" alt="vintage camera drawings" class="wp-image-6802"/><figcaption>This exercise introduces students to different mediums and provides experience rendering a range of different reflective, smooth and faintly textured man-made surfaces. It also provides great way to spark other Visual Art interests and share knowledge about early photographic techniques.</figcaption></figure>

---

<p><strong>A glass of water</strong>, such as this example by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.touchtalent.com/3d-art/art/Glass-of-water-realistic-pencil-drawing-294896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hanna Asfour</a>:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140253/glass-water-drawing-1.jpg" alt="drawing a glass of water" class="wp-image-6804"/><figcaption>Although it is virtually impossible for a high school class to get to the end of a water-based lesson without somebody spilling something, this exercise can be a stunning and challenging task that really helps conquer the fear of transparent surfaces head-on. With good lighting, this task allows students to render the glass, water and the sparkling tonal variations within the shadow. A task of this nature can be a great one-lesson activity, perhaps set as ‘test’ or one-off assignment.</figcaption></figure>

---

<p><strong>A jug and cup of tea</strong>, with inspiration from cubist still life paintings by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/works/35572" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Juan Gris</a>:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140254/juan-gris-still-life-1.jpg" alt="Juan Gris still life" class="wp-image-6785"/><figcaption>After preparing the drawing surface&nbsp;with a painted ground and glued down paper (some of which may have decorative patterns that mimic wood grain or a table cloth, for example), students may overlay fragments of observational drawings, from slightly distorted angles, with tone softly applied n the style of Juan Gris. This synthetic cubist piece was completed in 1914 using oil and mixed media and is titled ‘Breakfast’.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Marbles, spheres and balls</strong>, inspired by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pedrocampos.net/index/gallery.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pedro Campos</a>&nbsp;paintings:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140254/pedro-campos-paintings-1.jpg" alt="Pedro Campos paintings" class="wp-image-6805"/><figcaption>Well known contemporary still life artist Pedro Campos creates hyper realistic still life paintings, such as the marble and golf ball oil on canvas work, ‘Camp Creek’, above. Drawing marbles and other spherical objects challenges students to focus all of their attention upon color, tone and surface; capturing glistening reflections and textural variations to enhance the illusion of reality.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Shells</strong>, as in these artworks from the students of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.elizabethjendek-visualarts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elizabeth Jendek</a>&nbsp;(from left to right): Marisa Leong,&nbsp;Supanan Lee,&nbsp;Miri Morita,&nbsp;Warin (Pinky) Rungsakaolert and&nbsp;Po Yuan, completed while studying at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tcis.ac.th/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thai Chinese International School</a>, Samutprakarn, Thailand:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140255/shells-art-lesson-1.jpg" alt="Drawing shells: art lesson" class="wp-image-6806"/><figcaption>In addition to provided a wealth of varied visually interesting forms, shells are durable enough to survive the energy of a high school Art classroom. In this stunning unit of work, students have produced vibrant, high contrast oil pastel artworks. These works were completed after formally analysing the work of Georgia O’Keeffe, working first-hand from still life arrangements, mirrors to help generate complex compositions.</figcaption></figure>

---

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140256/drawing-insects-bugs-1.jpg" alt="Art lesson: drawing insects" class="wp-image-6807"/><figcaption>Drawing insects can be challenging, due to difficulty sourcing first-hand imagery. It is sometimes possible to purchase dried and preserved insects in display cases and to use a magnifying glass to make the task of observing details easier (Science Departments often have a set of these). The striking examples above have been completed using black pen applied in dots (stippled) to a watercolor ground.</figcaption></figure>

---

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140257/cacti-painting-1.jpg" alt="Painting of plants and cacti" class="wp-image-6808"/><figcaption>With an appropriate selection of plants (ideally those that can survive long periods without attentive care) and interestingly shaped plant pots, this can form the basis of a great still life painting lesson plan. These works by Laura Garcia Serventi include a variety of contrasting plant forms and flowers, with different subtle patterns, pots positioned on a dramatic tiled floor.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Origami or folded paper</strong>, inspired by this observational drawings&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smdooley.com/Class/draw101/p1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sean Dooley</a>, a graduate of Savannah College of Art and Design:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140258/paper-crane-drawing-1.jpg" alt="Paper crane drawing" class="wp-image-6175"/><figcaption>Folding paper can create stunning shadows and a mesh of intriguing angular lines. This example is one that is included in our list of substitute art lessons, and can involve students first constructing origami, before producing observational drawings in a range of different media.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Bones and skeletons</strong>, as in this example by Year 11 student Manisha Mistry, from ACG Strathallan College (please view her full&nbsp;<a href="https://www.studentartguide.com/featured/gcse-art-sketchbook-coursework" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGCSE Art and Design Coursework project</a>):</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140259/GCSE-art-sketchbook-bones-1.jpg" alt="IGCSE Art sketchbook bones" class="wp-image-6809"/><figcaption>Folding paper can create stunning shadows and a mesh of intriguing angular lines. This example is one that is included in our list of substitute art lessons, and can involve students first constructing origami, before producing observational drawings in a range of different media.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Complex interiors and window panes</strong>, as in this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.moma.org/explore/multimedia/audios/220/2272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Henri Matisse</a>&nbsp;still life:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140300/henri-matisse-still-life-1.jpg" alt="Henri Matisse still life" class="wp-image-6811"/><figcaption>Titled ‘Still life after Jan Davidsz De Heem’s ‘La Desserte’’ this painting is Matisse’s interpretation of a work by seventeenth-century Dutch painter Jan Davidsz de Heem. Drawing influences from cubism, Matisse contructs the scene using intersecting angular lines. In this exercise, the background may take on equal importance with the central still life, with open windows / table surfaces / surrounding items becoming a prominent part of the composition. This task may also become an ‘inverted still life’, where the still life arrangement is pushed into the foreground, with background items helping to set the scene and tell a story.</figcaption></figure>

---

<p><strong>Old shoes and sandals</strong>, as in these examples by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vincent van Gogh</a>:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140303/van-gogh-still-life-shoes-1.jpg" alt="Vincent van Gogh, still life with shoes" class="wp-image-6812"/><figcaption>The traditional&nbsp;‘still life with old shoe’ remains a popular choice among Art students. Shiny surfaces often contrast metal buckles, twisted laces and furled edges of leather. Shoe polish and brushes can also be a great addition. These van Gogh still life paintings were completed using oil on canvas in the 1880s and are titled ‘A pair of shoes’ (top) and ‘Three pairs of shoes’ (bottom).</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Art-making equipment</strong>, such as is this example by Textiles Art teacher&nbsp;<a href="http://thelifeofatextilesteacher.blogspot.co.nz/2010/09/first-years.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gayle Bicknell</a>, which was prepared as part of a lesson for her BTEC art class at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.altoncollege.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alton College</a>, Hampshire, UK:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140304/tool-drawing-ideas-1.jpg" alt="still life ideas - art equipment and tools" class="wp-image-6813"/><figcaption>This topic lends itself to Jim Dine inspired charcoal still life drawings – working with a range of mixed media and textural backgrounds. This teaching example by Gayle is a graphite drawing of a single pair of scissors over a collaged background that has then been photographed and digitally manipulated.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Woodworking tools</strong>, as inspired by this teaching exercise by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jaimetreadwell.com/dccc-jim-dine-project-description.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jaime Brett Treadwell</a>, artist and full-time Professor who teaches foundation courses for all AFA programs offered at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dccc.edu/continuing-education/personal-interest-enrichment/creative-arts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delaware County Community College</a>&nbsp;including Studio Arts, Graphic Design, and Photography:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140305/jim-dine-tools-project-1.jpg" alt="Jim Dine tools art project" class="wp-image-6814"/><figcaption>In this task, students are encouraged to set tools upon a sheet of white paper, with a light source (such as an inexpensive table lamp) shining upon from an angle that creates interesting shadows. Students use a viewfinder to select a composition from the arrangement, considering the relationship between positive and negative spaces. The image is created using a range of experimental techniques, such as erasing back areas, rubbing the paper with napkins and so on. Visually pleasing tools that are scarred and battered with use can often be sourced at low cost from second hand shops (remember it is best to avoid those that may cause inadvertent injury). As with above, woodworking tools are a great subject matter to use while studying the work of Jim Dine.</figcaption></figure>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140306/flax-weaving-drawing-1.jpg" alt="flax weaving drawing" class="wp-image-6815"/><figcaption>In this still life lesson students were required to research traditional flax weaving methods and make their own experimental weaving. They then created observational drawings from these and photocopied the weaving for subsequent tasks. Weaving drawings offer the opportunity for students to practise blending colors in a wide range of different mediums.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Musical instruments</strong>, as in this detail from a&nbsp;<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pieter_Claesz_-_Vanitas_Still_Life_with_the_Spinario,_1628.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pieter Claesz</a>&nbsp;vanitas still life:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140307/pieter-claesz-vanitas-still-life-1.jpg" alt="Pieter Claesz vanitas still life" class="wp-image-6816"/><figcaption>High school Music Departments are sometimes willing to lend instruments that can be used in still life displays; with instruments overlapping in order to create interesting shadows, as in the detail of the oil painting above by Pieter Claesz. This work is titled ‘Vanitas Still Life with the Spinario’ and was painted in 1628.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Old books</strong>, such as this example of a&nbsp;<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Unknown_Dutch_Master-_Still-Life_with_Books.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dutch still life</a>&nbsp;with books completed in 1628 (artist unknown):</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140308/dutch-still-life-examples-1.jpg" alt="Dutch still life examples" class="wp-image-6817"/><figcaption>Beautiful old books can often be purchased from second-hand shops. School English, Geography, Science and History Departments also may have great old textbooks that have been discarded by past students or are no longer used. Many of these may have student graphite, dates or other annotation in them that can provide welcome variety and visual interest in still life drawings and paintings of books.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Still life with flowers</strong>, inspired by these&nbsp;<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vincent_van_Gogh_-_Four_Cut_Sunflowers.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vincent van Gogh</a>&nbsp;sunflowers:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140308/vincent-van-gogh-sunflowers-1.jpg" alt="Vincent van Gogh sunflowers" class="wp-image-6818"/><figcaption>A drawing of flowers can become cliché, ‘pretty’ or uninspiring (adding to the endless formulaic roses, hibiscus or lily flower drawings that fill the world). Extreme care should be taken to guide students away from ‘rote’ or ‘formulaic’ drawing, where the flower is drawn from memory or step-by-step according to some predetermined pattern, without first-hand observation of form or tone. You might choose uncommon flowers, or those that are damaged, dried or decayed, for example. Rather than in a flower pot or vase, the flowers might be scattered upon the ground, as in ‘Four cut sunflowers’ by van Gogh above. It is also worth noting that flower still life drawings and paintings can also be a hit with family members, with many parents enthusiastically displaying flower drawings (much more so that with some of the other still life suggestions on this page)!</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Lamps, lanterns and light bulbs</strong>, as in this charcoal drawing by&nbsp;<a href="http://akrawczyk83.deviantart.com/art/Still-life-with-bottle-and-lamp-329320582" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Akrawczyk</a>:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140309/charcoal-lamp-drawing-1.jpg" alt="charcoal lamp drawing" class="wp-image-6820"/><figcaption>In addition to transparency and curving reflective surfaces, these still life objects often have thin wires and/or power cords – and often emit light themselves – making them an extra challenging and exciting object to draw.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Contemporary food and packages</strong>, as in this still life painting by Tom Wesselmann (Art ©&nbsp;<a href="http://tomwesselmannestate.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Estate of Tom Wesselmann</a>&nbsp;/ Licensed by VAGA, New York, NY):</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140310/tom-wesselmann-still-life-1.jpg" alt="Tom Wesselmann still llife" class="wp-image-6821"/><figcaption>Collections of popular contemporary foodstuffs – bright packages and eye catching labels – can be used to create stunning compositions, as in this Tom Wesselmann still life. Many of these ‘pop objects’ have the benefit that they are packaged and long-lasting, able to be stored for some time in an Art room cupboard.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>A cluttered desk</strong>, inspired by this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/resource/1774/the-attributes-of-the-arts-and-the-rewards-which-are-accorded-them" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin</a>&nbsp;still life:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140311/chardin-still-life-1.jpg" alt="Chardin still life" class="wp-image-6822"/><figcaption>Although Art students are often masters of the cluttered desk syndrome, this task can be set up within a classroom with more purpose, so that the selected objects are part of a narrative, whereby the composition conveys a particular backstory and meaning. In this Chardin still life, titled ‘The Attributes of the Arts and the Rewards Which Are Accorded Them’, completed using oil on canvas, objects have been selected to represent various artistic disciplines – painting, drawing, architecture and sculpture – and are arranged alongside a ribbon with a cross, the highest award an artist in this region and time could apparently receive. The work was completed using oil on canvas in 1766.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Eggs</strong>, as in this AP Studio Art summer assignment set by teacher&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/richland2.org/billhicks/welcome/apphotography/ap-summer-assignments-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Billy Hicks</a>:</p>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140313/drawing-of-eggs-1.jpg" alt="drawing of eggs" class="wp-image-6824"/><figcaption>Students throughout the ages have voiced their frustration when they are set the task of applying tone to drawings of eggs, however almost all see the value of the exercise when the work is complete. This still life activity involves a contrast of textures, with the smooth eggs resting on textured cloth or crumpled paper towel to create a visually pleasing composition. Another variation involves drawing open egg shells, with light falling across the concave and convex surfaces.</figcaption></figure>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140315/still-life-drapery-1.jpg" alt="still life: drapery and clothing" class="wp-image-6827"/><figcaption>Shirts, dresses and other clothing items, which might include coat hangers, zips, buttons, belts, buckles, items of adornment, as well as traditional costumes, offer the opportunity to draw draped folded fabric alongside more complex accessories, pleats, seams and textile details. In the exercise above, students produce realistic drawings of a personal item of clothing that are pinned to a display panel (the panel can be shifted aside and placed in storage until the next class).</figcaption></figure>

<figure class="madtinker_main"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/image-control-storage/2020/04/21140316/hanging-still-life-1.jpg" alt="hanging still life" class="wp-image-6828"/><figcaption>A still life composition that is created from hanging objects has the presence of the string to create tension and linear elements, alongside unexpected shadows, angles and alignment of objects. It can also result in dramatic contemporary imagery, as students hang and explore unusual subject matter.</figcaption></figure>
